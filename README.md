# Sine_curve_optimization
This simple program optimizes  random data in the form of a sine wave using ANN. The model uses SIREN network which uses sine as activation function, adam optimizer, MSE as loss function and 2000 epochs. MAPE of the model was 4.729%. An AI generated GIF is also attached with 200 epochs.
